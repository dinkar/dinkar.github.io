This page belongs to Dinkar Pundir, a veteran chipmonk, who currently is under the mission to understand how humans do what they do. When he is not staring at the walls or giggling after throwing water at kittens, he likes to think up of plans to rule the world. More or less his strategy till now has been to wait for all the humans to willingly surrender themselfes, but that might not happen anytime soon. Till then he has planned to reside in Noida, working for a company known to the world as Proptiger.

Feel free to contact him at {{site.email}}. Nay, I insist that you do contact him. Pretty pwease! Pretty. Pwease.

His Twitter handle is @{{site.twitter_username}}.
