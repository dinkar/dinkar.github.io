This site belongs to Dinkar Pundir, a veteran chipmonk, who currently is under the mission to understand how humans do what they do. When he is not staring at the walls or giggling after throwing water at kittens, he likes to think up of plans to rule the world. More or less his strategy till now has been to wait for all the humans to willingly surrender themselves, but that might not happen anytime soon. Till then he has planned to reside in Noida, and work for a company known to the world as Proptiger.

Feel free to contact him at {{site.email}}.

His Twitter handle is @{{site.twitter_username}}.
