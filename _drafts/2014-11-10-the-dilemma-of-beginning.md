title: Dilemma of beginning
---

At the onset of each Friday night I make elaborate plans to complete the projects that I've undertaken for the my self-learning and evolution. But the time passes by minute-by-minute and I find myself this very position that I'm at now, essentially which means, that it is 12 midnight of Monday and I have not yet even begun on the project that I've procrastinated for ever so long. Months I should say. Why, nay, what is it that I require that would give me the impulse to launch myself at them and not stop until I finish. One thing, I reckon, is the lack of a person to motivate me to push myself forward. Sure there's Vishal, who seems to be one of the reason why I started with these projects in the first place. But even he's not the motivation that I need. It could've been Amy but even she's not the motivating kind, and when she herself is in the dearth of requisite amount of motivation who am I suppose to point the finger at her. At the end of it all, it boils down to simple realization that if I need some motivation I will have to go online and find out people whom I can look up to. 
What that essentially requires me to do is 
1. Go online and participate in forums and groups.
2. Find like minded people, if not better than me. 
3. Start conversation with them and find the suitable people after filtering out the regular shit.

There that seems to be the basic plan. Rudimentary it may be but hey, the beta phase is always the simplest implementation. It's continuous reiteration that leads to the best of application. So, this is my alpha idea. And I start acting upon it from tomorrow.
