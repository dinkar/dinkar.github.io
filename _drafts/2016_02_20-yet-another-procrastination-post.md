title: Yet another procrastination post
---

I recently came across an excellent post explaining the reasons **why** procrastinators procrastinate and effective ways to overcome procrastination. The post confirmed my minor confusion about my own nature, that I am and have always been a major procrastinator. The author, citing himself as a chronic procrastinator, mentioned some critical features of one, and those matched mine exactly. And I realised, through the post, that it's not willingly I exhibit those. I do because it's my inherent nature to do that. Like it's the nature of a tortoise to walk slow, or snakes to have animosity against weasels. And while all procrastinators know that they are procrastinators and they come up with elaborate plans on how to overcome that, most of them don't show improvement because of those very plans. The plans, though, are born out of good intention, are deficient of details. By details I imply the intricate information that is required to bring the sense of urgency of the tasks. So, for example, while a procrastinator candidly jots down "Learn Guitar", what he needs to do is mention exactly **how** to break down the learning process. He needs to mention the exact schedule of learning guitar, like, 

1. Practice chords on Monday.
2. Play chord C on Tuesday.

By doing this he makes sure that he **knows** when he's slacking. If he doesn't do this he'll, as you know, procrastinate, and then let go of the task. Whereas, **if** he manages to follow the first task as per schedule, he'll get in the zone of practice, because he'll notice the improvement. This will give him the satisfaction of achievement because he has made advancements in that task. On the other hand, if he doesn't start the first task, he'll get the dissatisfaction of already lacking the start. This might motivate him to start the task, because he knows that he has started procrastinating already. Thus, detailed planning is essential for procrastinators to ensure them from slacking. 

It is because of this I intend to do the planning more detailed from now on. This is my second blog post of the month out of the three that I've planned. This is a good start for me because last month I had finised none. 

Although, the blog post was an eye opener for me, I think, I had started moving in the right direction because the planning part had already been implemented by me. Over the course of few months I might have actually made some progress to overcome procrastination. But the post made me believe that I was headed in the right direction. 

I hope, this modus operandi works out and I overcome my procratination. This would be pivotal in achieving the goals that I've set for me. May the force be with me.
